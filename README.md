### Description

Bestow was created to help you keep track of all the things you borrow or lend. You can add items to your list by entering
who, what, and when your belongings were borrowed or bestowed. Bestow even keeps track of how long the item has been borrowed
or bestowed. You can easily edit and remove your belongings in the Card view. In the List view, you can display your belongings by who borrowed or bestowed them, what was borrowed or bestowed, or when it was borrowed or bestowed. There is
also a search feature if you're looking for something specific.
